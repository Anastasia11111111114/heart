‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Animation ‚Äì HTML Canvas Visualization
This project renders a dynamic and visually appealing animated heart using the HTML5 <canvas> element and JavaScript. It simulates colorful particles flowing along a mathematically generated heart path, creating a pulsating, fluid effect.

üîß Features
1. Canvas-based rendering of a heart shape using parametric equations.
2. Particle animation that traces and follows the heart's outline.
3. Responsive design: canvas resizes to fit the screen (mobile support included).
4. Colorful, semi-transparent trails that produce a glowing, heartbeat-like effect.
5. Device-aware performance scaling (fewer particles on mobile for smoother experience).

üìå Technologies Used
1. Pure HTML5, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
2. HTML5 Canvas API
3. requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
4. Mathematical functions for heart shape generation
